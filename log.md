**Today's Progress**: Breaking the rules already -- I worked through a Swift tutorial and am in the process of making my very first app.  Since I have no experience at all in Swift, I'm counting tutorial work for the first few days.  I'm following https://www.raywenderlich.com/4919757-your-first-ios-and-swiftui-app/ 

**Thoughts:** So far Swift is pretty easy to learn.  There's a lot in common with python and html, so that helps.  I'm making good progress
