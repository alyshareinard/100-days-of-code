### R1D1: Jan 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Breaking the rules already -- I worked through a Swift tutorial and am in the process of making my very first app.  Since I have no experience at all in Swift, I'm counting tutorial work for the first few days.  I'm following https://www.raywenderlich.com/4919757-your-first-ios-and-swiftui-app/ 

**Thoughts:** So far Swift is pretty easy to learn.  There's a lot in common with python and html, so that helps.  I'm making good progress

### R1D2: Jan 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I completed the "bullseye" Swift tutorial put a working bullseye App on my phone! Even better, though, I created my own app.  My son was practicing his times tables and he likes to see the numbers instead of hearing them -- so I made an app that lets him do just that. Had to spend lots of time on stackoverflow and google, but managed to put it together. It's an MVP now -- barebones, but works.  He likes it and we both have ideas for improving it.  

**Thoughts:** Yay!  My first app of my very own!

### R1D3: Jan 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Working through some details of the Times table app -- resizing the answer box, adjusting the layout.  Also made planning list and did a little research for a wine inventory app my sister-in-law requested. Made my own numpad since the built in one doesn't have a "done" button and so permanately blocks several of my buttons.  Added ability to keep track of and display points.  

**Thoughts:** The Swift number pad keyboard really needs a "return" or "done" button!  WTH?
